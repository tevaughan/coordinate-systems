# Coordinate Systems in Physical Space

An amateur foray into differential geometry, the present project aims to
provide a gentle introduction to coordinate systems in the physical space of
ordinary human experience.  Beginning with common-sense ideas found in
Euclidean geometry, I combine the coordinate-free idea of a vector with ideas
from calculus.  The end goal is to provide an introduction to special and
general relativity.
