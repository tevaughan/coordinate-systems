\chapter{Prolegomenon}

In the present book I work through the basics of differential geometry.  Also,
for coordinate systems and component transformations in Euclidean space, I
develop an approach that explicitly treats a certain kind of vector---for
example, one that might be chosen as a basis vector---as simple and independent
of any coordinate system.  This is inspired by ideas that Neil Huffaker
introduced in his graduate lectures on electrodynamics at the University of
Oklahoma in the early 1990s.  The material should be accessible to anyone who
has studied calculus-based physics.

The form of the book follows the style of Edward R.~Tufte and Richard Feynman
\citep{pkg-tufte}.

The title is ``Coordinate Systems in Physical Space,'' and a brief reflection
on the choice of title provides an introduction to the material.

\section{Coordinate Systems}

First of all, the book is about coordinate systems.  But what does
``coordinate'' mean?

\subsection{Coordinate}

In mathematics, a coordinate is typically a real number that constrains the
location of a point in a \emph{manifold}.  A manifold, in turn, is an
$n$-dimensional space that resembles Euclidean space at least in a small region
near every point in the space.\footnote{%
   We shall typically consider cases in which $n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$.%
}
From now on, we shall not use the word ``manifold'' but instead just use the
word ``space'' to mean the same thing: a \emph{locally Euclidean, mathematical
space}.  (We shall below, however, distinguish a mathematical space from a
physical space.)

\subsection{Coordinate Tuple and Coordinate System}

A point in an $n$-dimensional space is uniquely identified by an $n$-tuple, an
ordered set of $n$ coordinates.  A \emph{coordinate system} is a continuous,
one-to-one function that maps from the set of coordinate $n$-tuples onto the
points in the space.\footnote{%
   For the function to be continuous, an infinitesimal change in any coordinate
   must never correspond to a finite distance in the change of the mapped
   point.  The one-to-one nature of the mapping means that for every point in
   the space, there is exactly one tuple corresponding to it.%
}
Suppose that the first coordinate in the tuple is $x_1$, and the last is $x_n$.
Then we can specify any coordinate as $x_i$, where $i \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots,
n\}$.

\subsection{Coordinate Line}

Allowing the $i$th coordinate to vary, while holding every other coordinate at
fixed value, produces tuples for points along a \emph{coordinate line} for the
$i$th coordinate.

For example, the surface of a sphere is a two-dimensional space.  Each of the
latitude and the longitude is a coordinate.  These coordinates form a
two-tuple, or ordered pair, $(\alpha,\beta)$, where $\alpha$ is the latitude
and $\beta$ the longitude.  By holding the latitude fixed, one finds that the
set of longitudes maps to a parallel, a coordinate line for the longitude, on
the surface of the sphere.  See Figure~\ref{fig:sphere}.  Every path of
constant latitude on the sphere is called ``a parallel'' because no parallel
intersects any other parallel.  Among the parallels, only the equator is a
great circle; that is, the parallel at zero latitude is the only parallel
circle centered on the center of the sphere.  Every path of constant
longitude---that is, every coordinate line for the latitude---is called ``a
meridian'' and intersects every other meridian, both at the north pole and at
the south pole.  Every meridian is a great circle.

      draw(par, red);
      draw(prime, yellow);
      draw(mer, yellow);
   \end{asy}
   \end{center}

      parallel appear in red. Two meridians appear in yellow.%
   }
   \label{fig:sphere}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Value of Coordinate}

In my treatment, a coordinate is not necessarily a real number.  It might
instead be an irreducibly physical quantity, like a length.  A physical
quantity is not a number, but it can be expressed as the product of a number
and a standard unit, such as an inch.  What is generally required is that a
coordinate be an element of a simply ordered set.\footnote{%
   A set $S$ is simply ordered if, for every $a, b, c \in S$,
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item $a \leq b$ and $b \leq a$ imply that $a = b$;
      \item $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$ imply that $a \leq c$; and
      \item either $a \leq b$ or $b \leq a$.
   \end{enumerate}%
}
The real numbers are simply ordered, and so is the set of all lengths of the
form, $x = r \; \text{in}$, where $r$ is a real number, and ``$\text{in}$''
represents an inch.

\subsection{Arbitrary Choice of Coordinate System}

No particular coordinate system need be chosen for a given space, and so the
choice of coordinate system is arbitrary.  However, one coordinate system might
fit a space more naturally than another would fit it.  For example, the most
natural coordinate systems on the surface of an oblate
spheroid\footnote{%
   There is no preferred orientation for a grid of latitude and longitude on a
   perfect sphere.  An oblate spheroid is obtained by a scaling transformation
   that reduces the size of the sphere along a single direction.  The shape of
   the Earth is approximated by an oblate spheroid better than by a perfect
   sphere.%
}
would have the equator on the longest circumference of the spheroid.

\subsection{Cartesian Coordinate System}

There is a special kind of coordinate system, a \emph{Cartesian} coordinate
system.  In a Cartesian coordinate system, the shortest path between every pair
of points on every coordinate line lies on that coordinate line.  Not every
space admits a Cartesian coordinate system.  For example, the surface of a
sphere does not admit a Cartesian coordinate system.\footnote{%
   On the surface of the sphere, the shortest path between two distinct points
   along a parallel usually does not lie along the parallel.  The shortest path
   always lies along a great circle, and, except for the equator, a parallel is
   not a great circle.%
}
In fact, only a \emph{Euclidean} space admits a Cartesian coordinate system.
We shall see that what makes a Euclidean space special is that it has zero
\emph{curvature}.

\subsection{Transformation of Coordinate System}

We shall spend some time discussing the difference between a quantity that
depends on the choice of coordinate system and a quantity that does not depend
on the choice.  For a quantity that does depend on the coordinate system, we
shall explore, particularly for Cartesian coordinates, the different ways in
which a quantity can transform as the coordinate system changes.

\section{Physical Space}

A mathematical model of physical space is not physical space itself.  A model,
such as Euclidean space or the space-time of general relativity, is an abstract
thing in the mind.  Physical space is the space of direct, sensory experience.
Euclidean space is often a good model of physical space, but not always.  Each
of the models that I develop makes explicit what might be only implicit in a
standard mathematical treatment of space.  I do this so that each model, while
still essentially abstract, is concrete enough to be falsifiable like a
scientific theory and so that the model accords well with physical intuition.

\subsection{Explicit Principles}

Each of the models that I develop is based on two key principles.

First, a distance is not reduced to a number; rather, distance remains an
intuitive, undefined, physical, non-numeric quantity, expressed in terms of a
fundamental unit, such as the inch or the meter.  Nevertheless, a distance can
be multiplied by a number.

Second, neither a point in space nor a displacement vector between two points
is reduced to a tuple of quantities.  Rather, each of the point and the
displacement vector is regarded as both simple\footnote{%
   What is simple is not composed of parts; that is, not complex.  A tuple of
   coordinates is complex in that it has parts (coordinates).  A coordinate
   system maps a tuple to a point in space, but the point has no parts.  The
   point is simply a location.%
}
and logically prior to any coordinate system.

\subsection{Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Models}

As a global physical hypothesis, Euclidean geometry has been ruled out by
experiment.\footnote{%
   Experiments in lunar ranging from the surface of the Earth and data from the
   spacecraft, Gravity Probe B, have directly and repeatably measured the
   curvature of space near the Earth. The results are inconsistent with
   Euclidean physical space.  \citep{gpb-2011, miller-geodetic}
}
However, even in the non-Euclidean geometries of modern physics, the Euclidean
ideal is a better and better approximation as the size of the region of space
under consideration becomes smaller and smaller.  While Euclidean geometry as a
physical hypothesis applied globally has been ruled out, Euclidean geometry as
applied separately to every sufficiently small region of physical space has not
been ruled out.  In fact, the space of general relativity, which has not (yet)
been ruled out, is called ``a locally Euclidean space.''

Anyway, most of the narrative of the book is set in the practically Euclidean,
three-dimensional space of ordinary experience, but the non-Euclidean,
two-dimensional space of the surface of the sphere is also explored.  Also, we
shall at least briefly discuss both special relativity and general relativity.

\chapter{Distance}
\label{ch:distance}

A point, as introduced in high-school geometry, is a particular, pure location,
without any \emph{extent}.  An object such as
\begin{itemize}
   \item a curve (a one-dimensional space),
   \item a surface (a two-dimensional space),
   \item a proper space (a three-dimensional space), or
   \item a hyperspace (a space with four or more dimensions)
\end{itemize}
has points in it.

\begin{figure}
   \begin{center}
   \begin{asy}
      defaultpen(fontsize(8pt));
      settings.prc = false;
      size(4cm,0);
      import three;
      real step = pi/4;
      triple p0 = cos(0*step)*X + sin(0*step)*Y;
      triple p1 = cos(1*step)*X + sin(1*step)*Y;
      triple p2 = cos(2*step)*X + sin(2*step)*Y;
      triple p3 = cos(3*step)*X + sin(3*step)*Y;
      triple p4 = cos(4*step)*X + sin(4*step)*Y;
      path3 a = arc(c=O, v1=p0, v2=p4);
      currentprojection=orthographic(camera=Z);
      draw(a);
      draw(p0--p2--p4, blue);
      draw(p0--p1--p2--p3--p4, red);
   \end{asy}
   \end{center}
   \caption{%
      Convergence toward limiting length of arc.  The length along the curved
      path is the limit of a sequence of approximate sums.  The sum of the red
      distances is an approximation better than the sum of the blue distances.
      The smooth arc is not composed of an infinite number of straight
      segments. That would be a contradiction; the curve has no straight parts.
      Rather, the \emph{length} of the curved arc is the limit of a sequence of
      sums of distances.  No sum will in general be equal to the length along
      the curve, but the limit of the sequence of sums can be found.%
   }
   \label{fig:arc}
\end{figure}

An extent is an unbroken \emph{length} corresponding to a thing's size.  What I
call ``length'' is the principle of extension.  A geometric object might be
extended in multiple ways, as in width and in height.  Each of the width and
the height is fundamentally a length, though each is a length in a different
dimension.  For example, consider a 180-degree, circular arc of one-meter
radius.  There is a length along the arc.  The arc also has some extension in
each of the two dimensions of the plane.  See Figure~\ref{fig:arc}.

\section{Shortest Path}

Between any two points in a space, there is a special length called a
\emph{distance}; contained in this idea is, as it turns out, most of what we
mean by ``space.'' The distance between any two points in a space is the length
of the shortest path between them.

For a one-dimensional space, the existence of a distance between any two points
implies that the space itself is a single, unbroken extent.

For a space of two or more dimensions, however, the existence of a distance
between any two points implies that there are infinitely many unbroken paths
between the two points and that one of those paths has the shortest
length.

\subsection{Length Along Curve}

The length along a curve is the limit of a sequence of sums, each an
approximation better than the previous.  See Figure~\ref{fig:arc}.  Each
further sum in the sequence is the sum of a larger number of smaller distances.
So long as the curve be \emph{smooth}, the limit of the sequence of the sums is
the length of the curve.  A curve is smooth if, for any two points sufficiently
close together along the curve, the difference between
\begin{itemize}
   \item their separation distance and
   \item the length between them along the curve
\end{itemize}
is so small as desired.

\section{Principle of Extension}

Just as any length is properly composed of distances, a surface is composed of
areas, and a space is composed of volumes.  In turn, the idea of area and the
idea of volume are built upon the idea of length and therefore, ultimately,
upon the idea of distance.

Regardless of the number of dimensions a space might have, it can support the
basic notion of extended geometry only if there be a unique \emph{distance}
between every pair of points in the space.  A path of definite length is not
merely a collection of points but also a rule for associating a unique distance
between every pair of points on the path.  The idea of distance is the
principle of continuous, unbroken geometry.
A continuous length is properly divided not into an infinite regress of points
but rather into an infinite regress of contiguous elements of
distance.\footnote{%
   There is a problem that can arise from imagining a curve (for example) as
   \emph{merely} a collection of points.  Because a point has no length, no
   point can touch another point.  Regardless of how close together two points
   might be, each has zero length, and so there is a gap between them.  Because
   no point can touch another point, there is no arrangement of points, lying
   in unbroken contact, such that they constitute a length.  The idea of an
   unbroken length, a continuously extended path, is more fundamental than the
   idea of a point:  A point is a pure location \emph{in} something, such as a
   curve, a surface, or proper space.  Beginning in the 20th Century, a
   geometric object has often been considered as essentially a collection of
   points.  Although this can be reasonable, one must remember that there is
   also, intrinsically involved in this conception, the independent idea of a
   \emph{distance} between every pair of points.%
}
In fact, this distinction is precisely what enables integral calculus to work.
