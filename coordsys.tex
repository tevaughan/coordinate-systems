\chapter{Distance}
\label{ch:distance}

\newthought{A point}, as introduced in high-school geometry, is a particular,
pure location, without any extent: no length, no width, no height.

\newthought{In modern mathematics}, every other geometric thing, such as the
line (one-dimensional space), the plane (two-dimensional space), and the proper
space (three-dimensional space), is introduced as merely a collection of
points.

\bigskip
Yet there is a problem that comes from imagining, say, a line segment as merely
a collection of points.  A line segment has length, but a point has no length.
No point can touch another distinct point, and so points cannot simply lie in
unbroken contact, such that their lengths add up to that of the segment.  In
high-school physics, the student learns to do mathematical calculation with
physical units.  Two quantities cannot be added together if they differ in
fundamental dimension, and if two quantities agree in dimension, their sum must
be expressible in terms of the same unit.\sidenote{%
   For example, one cannot evaluate the sum of a distance and a mere number, as
   in $3 \text{m} + 2$, where ``$\text{m}$'' indicates ``meter''. Also, the
   result of $2 + 5$ cannot be $7 \text{m}$.}
A point has exactly zero length, and so one cannot construct a line segment
three meters long by adding up the width of every point.

A solution to this problem is found in the calculus.  The length along a
section of a curve is the limit of an ever-increasing number of ever-smaller,
contiguous, straight segments along the curve and intersecting it at least at
the endpoints of each segment.  The section is thereby divided into an infinite
number of segments, but each segment has a length and is therefore not a point.
Even in the limit, each segment still has some length, though infinitesimally
small, and so the segments can be added together to produce a finite length.
The dimension of the addends is the dimension of the sum.

Similarly, a surface must be composed of bits with area, and a space must be
composed of bits with volume.  The idea of area and the idea of volume are
built upon the idea of length, of distance.

Regardless of the number of dimensions of length a space might have, it can
support basic notions of geometry only if there be a unique \emph{distance}
between every pair of points in the space.  A line is not merely a collection
of points but also a rule for associating a distance between every pair of
points on the line.
