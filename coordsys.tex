\chapter{Distance}
\label{ch:distance}

\newthought{A point}, as introduced in high-school geometry, is a particular,
pure location, without any extent: no length, no width, no height.

There is a problem that can arise from imagining, say, a section of a curve as
merely a collection of points.  A section of a curve has a length, but a point
has no length.  No point can touch another distinct point, and so points cannot
lie in unbroken contact, such that their lengths add up to that of the section.
In high-school physics, the student learns to do mathematical calculation with
physical dimensions.  Two quantities cannot be added together if they differ in
dimension, and if two quantities agree in dimension, their sum must be of the
same dimension.\sidenote[][-0.5in]{%
   For example, one cannot evaluate the sum of a distance and a mere number, as
   in $3 \: \text{m}^2 + 2$, where ``$\text{m}$'' indicates ``meter''.  The
   first term has the dimension of area, and the second term is dimensionless.
   Also, the result of $2 + 5$ cannot be $7 \: \text{m}$.}
A point has not extension in the dimension of length, and so even if two
distinct points could touch, there is no way to add up any property in each
point to result in a length.

      draw(a);
      draw(X--(cos(3*pi/8)*X+sin(3*pi/8)*Y)--(cos(3*pi/4)*X+sin(3*pi/4)*Y), blue);
      draw(X--(cos(3*pi/16)*X+sin(3*pi/16)*Y)--(cos(3*pi/8)*X+sin(3*pi/8)*Y)--
           (cos(9*pi/16)*X+sin(9*pi/16)*Y)--(cos(3*pi/4)*X+sin(3*pi/4)*Y), red);

   \caption{%
      Convergence toward limiting length of arc.  The integral of the length
      along the curved path is the limit of a sequence of approximate sums.
      The sum of the red lengths is a better approximation than the sum of the
      blue lengths. The claim made in the calculus is not that the smooth arc
      is really composed of an infinite number of straight segments. That would
      be a contradiction. A curve is not straight. Rather, the claim is that
      the length of the curved arc is the limit of a sequence of sums of
      contiguous, straight segments.  No sum of straight segments will in
      general be equal to the length along the curve, but the limit of the
      sequence of sums can be found.%

\newthought{A solution to this problem} is found in the calculus.  In physical
space, there is a distance between any two distinct points.  The length of a
section of a curve is the limit of the sum an ever-increasing number of
ever-smaller distances, each between a pair of points on the curve.  In the
limit, the section is divided into an infinite number of segments, but each
segment has a length.  No matter how many segments there might be, each segment
still has some length, and so the segments can be added together to produce a
finite length.  The dimension of the addends is the dimension of the sum.

Similarly, a surface must be composed of bits with area, and a space must be
composed of bits with volume.  The idea of area and the idea of volume are
built upon the idea of length, of distance.

Regardless of the number of dimensions of length a space might have, it can
support basic notions of geometry only if there be a unique \emph{distance}
between every pair of points in the space.  A path through physical space is
not merely a collection of points but also a rule for associating a distance
between every pair of points on the path.
