\chapter{Space}
\label{ch:space}

\newthought{A point}, as introduced in high-school geometry, is a particular,
pure location, without any extent: no length, no width, no height.

\newthought{Every other geometric thing}, such as the line, the plane, and the
space, is introduced as merely a collection of points.

\bigskip
Yet there is a problem that comes from imagining, say, a line segment as merely
a collection of points.  A line segment has length, but a point has no length.
No point can touch another distinct point, and so points cannot simply lie in
unbroken contact, such that their lengths add up to that of the segment.  In
high-school physics, the student learns to do mathematical calculation with
physical units.  One cannot add two quantities together if one have a unit of a
kind different from that of the other quantity.\sidenote{%
   For example, one cannot add a two kilograms and three meters.}
A point has no extent in meters, and so one cannot construct a line segment
three meters long merely by adding points together.

The solution to this problem is found in the calculus.  The length along a
segment of a curve is the limit of an ever-increasing number of ever-smaller
straight lengths along the curve.  (Such an approach can be used to find the
length of a straight-line segment, too.)  The segment is divided into an
infinite number of things, but each of these things is a length, not a point.
Even in the limit, each piece still has some length, though infinitesimally
small, and so the pieces can be added together to produce a finite length.

Similarly, a surface must be composed of bits with area, and a space must be
composed of bits with volume.
