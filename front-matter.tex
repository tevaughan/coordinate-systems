\chapter*{Prolegomenon}

The present book is an introduction to the idea of a coordinate system in the
three-dimensional, physical space of ordinary experience.

The subject matter touches on concepts in differential geometry but is aimed at
the development of a consistent notation, both for the definition of a
coordinate system and for the transformation of the coordinate-dependent
components of a coordinate-free quantity.  I have been dissatisfied with the
traditional approach and should like to expose ideas that Neil Huffaker
introduced in his graduate lectures on electrodynamics at the University of
Oklahoma in the early 1990s.  The material should be accessible to anyone who
has studied calculus-based physics.

The format of the book follows the style of Edward R.~Tufte and Richard
Feynman \citep{pkg-tufte}.

Not purely mathematical, the treatment below involves at least two key elements
of physical theory.  In the first place, the idea of distance is not reduced to
the idea of number.  Rather, distance remains an intuitive, undefined,
physical, non-numeric quantity, expressed in terms of a fundamental unit, such
as the inch or the meter.  Nevertheless, this quantity can be multiplied by a
number.  In the second place, neither a location in space nor a displacement
vector between two points in space is reduced to an ordered set of quantities.
Rather, each of the location and the vector is regarded as simple, logically
prior to any coordinate system, and independent of it.

Like physics in general, my treatment below is not purely mathematical:
Location, distance, and direction are physical realities, though they are
amenable to mathematical description.  Such a description can be tested by
experiment.  The Euclidean description, for example, has been ruled out by
experiment.\sidenote[][-0.3in]{%
   At least a couple of experiments, including lunar ranging and Gravity Probe
   B, have directly and repeatably measured the curvature of space near the
   Earth. The results are inconsistent with Euclidean physical space.
   \citep{gpb-2011, miller-geodetic}
}
Whereas a purely mathematical development cannot be ruled out by experiment, a
mathematical hypothesis about physical reality can be ruled out.  Applying
Euclid to the physical world amounts to asserting an hypothesis of physics.
What keeps an hypothesis from being purely mathematical is its reference to
concrete physical quantities, such as distance, rather than only to
abstractions, such as number.\sidenote[][-0.3in]{%
   In an explicitly physical treatment, a number multiplies the physical
   quantity in order to scale it.}

\cite{rowe-2006} argues that one of the reasons why the non-Euclidean geometry
of physical space was difficult to accept at the beginning of the 20th Century
is that geometry---Euclidean geometry---had long been commonly regarded not
just as mathematical but also as physical.  So no experiment could ever
contradict it.  Immanuel Kant's position \citep{huggett-2010} was that
knowledge of the geometry of space is certain (and, of course, Euclidean, as
Kant lived before Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, the influential developer
of differential geometry).  At least since Albert Einstein, however, ``[i]t
seems reasonable,'' Huggett writes, ``to believe that we can also use
experiment to establish the geometry of space---not with mathematical or
logical certainty, but as reliable empirical knowledge.''

Euclidean geometry can, in a sense, be regarded as purely mathematical.  It
remains valid as an artifact of mathematical reasoning applied to a small set
of axioms, and it can be disconnected from physical space.  For example,
distance can be made abstract, as by reducing it to the idea of number.

What is not purely mathematical is the hypothesis according to which Euclid
perfectly describes the geometry of physical space.  \emph{That} hypothesis has
been tested and found wanting.  To apply Euclidean geometry to physical space
is to contradict the results of experiment.

However, even in the non-Euclidean geometries of modern physics, the Euclidean
ideal is a better and better approximation as the size of the region of space
under consideration becomes smaller and smaller.  While Euclidean geometry as a
physical hypothesis applied globally has been ruled out by experiment,
Euclidean geometry as a physical hypothesis applied separately to every
sufficiently small region of physical space has not been ruled out.  In fact,
the space of general relativity is called ``a locally Euclidean space.''

Anyway, most of the narrative of the book is set in the practically Euclidean,
three-dimensional space of ordinary experience, but the non-Euclidean,
two-dimensional space of the surface of the sphere is also explored.
